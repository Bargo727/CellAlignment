# CellAlignment
The names of the files given in this repository correspond to the analogous figures in the paper "Boundary-Driven Emergent Spatiotemporal Order in Growing Microbial Colonies".  Simply open the code, run it on the proper program, and the figures should emerge.

#fig2
The files in this folder are written in C++ and are especially written for Qt Creator.  One needs to download _gro_ software along with these files in order for it to run properly.  These are available open source.

#fig3 and 4
These files contain MATLAB code.  Simply run them.  The fig3cd.m file may be easily modified to produce the 3 x 3 figure in the SI.  Read the commentary within that file.  Similarly, code in fig4 files may be modified to reproduce the SI figures showing how /kappa scales with $s$ for several different interaction kernels.

#avi files
These files produce videos showing how the equilibria in fig 2 of the paper are attained from their random initialization.

#InitialVacancies.m is a MATLAB program that allows for intiail conditions with vacancies.  This program serves to show that having vacancies initially is not necessary for the model to proceed as we describe in the paper.
